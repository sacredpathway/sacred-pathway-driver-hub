-- Links loads to fleet units. Both FKs are NULLABLE so:
--   • Existing loads (created by iOS or earlier web flows) keep working
--     unchanged — no backfill needed.
--   • Carriers without a fleet section filled out can still record loads.
--   • Deleting a truck/trailer does NOT cascade-delete loads; the FK uses
--     ON DELETE SET NULL so historical loads keep their attribution metadata
--     but the link is severed.
--
-- Rules:
--   • Additive only — no DROP, no RENAME, no NOT NULL tightening.
--   • Idempotent — ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS, CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS.
--   • Zero iOS impact — the iOS Swift Load model ignores unknown columns
--     when decoding, so legacy clients keep parsing loads correctly.
