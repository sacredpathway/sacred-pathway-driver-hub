-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Read-only SQL view that unions legacy `settlements` rows (still produced by
-- iOS) with the new `paystubs` rows (produced by the web app) into one
-- "all payroll history" feed.
--
-- Used by:
--   • Carrier HQ payroll-history list  (`/payroll` route)
--   • Reports tab — payroll analytics
--   • Future CPA / tax exports
--
-- Anything reading from this view inherits each underlying table's RLS,
-- because PostgreSQL applies RLS based on the querying role and the source
-- tables — the view is just a column projection.
--
-- Settlements that have been linked to a new paystub (settlements.paystub_id
-- IS NOT NULL) are filtered OUT of the legacy branch to avoid double-counting.
--
-- Rules:
--   • Additive only.
--   • Idempotent (CREATE OR REPLACE).
--   • No DML, no triggers, no side effects.

COMMENT ON VIEW public.v_payroll_unified IS
  'Unified read-only feed of all payroll history. Combines new paystubs '
  '(W2 + 1099 written by the web) with legacy settlements (1099 written '
  'by the iOS app), filtering out legacy rows that have been re-issued '
  'as a paystub. RLS is inherited from the underlying tables.';
